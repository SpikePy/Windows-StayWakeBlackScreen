# Details

Full reference for Windows StayWakeBlackScreen. See [README.md](README.md)
for the overview and quick start.

## Programs

### `StayWakeBlackScreen.exe`

Blacks out every screen and blocks **all** keyboard and mouse input
system-wide immediately when run. The only way out is the **Escape** key.

```
StayWakeBlackScreen.exe
StayWakeBlackScreen.exe -heartbeat-seconds 5 -enable-logging
```

### `StayWakeBlackScreenIdle.exe`

Runs quietly in the background — no black screen, no input blocking, and
a tray icon — preventing sleep/lock, until the PC has been genuinely idle
(no real keyboard/mouse activity) for `idle_minutes` (default 3). At that
point it blacks out and blocks input exactly like the program above.
Pressing **Escape** dismisses the blackout and restores input, but it
keeps running and the idle countdown restarts — it will black out again
after another idle period, indefinitely.

```
StayWakeBlackScreenIdle.exe
StayWakeBlackScreenIdle.exe -idle-minutes 3 -heartbeat-seconds 5 -enable-logging
```

This program does not exit on its own. To stop it: the tray menu's
*Exit*, Task Manager/`taskkill`, or the installer (which does this
automatically when updating).

### `Setup_StayWakeBlackScreenIdle.exe`

Run it with no arguments (e.g. double-click it) and it shows an
interactive menu:

```
Windows StayWakeBlackScreen - Setup

  1) Install / update
  2) Uninstall

Choose an option [1-2] (installing/updating automatically in 5 seconds if nothing is chosen):
```

If nothing is chosen within 5 seconds of the first prompt, it goes ahead
with **Install / update** on its own — so double-clicking it and walking
away still gets the tool installed/updated. Typing anything (even an
invalid choice) cancels the countdown for the rest of that run. When the
action was auto-chosen this way, the window also closes itself 3 seconds
after finishing (instead of waiting for Enter) — nobody was there to
pick it, so there's likely nobody there to dismiss it either. If that
unattended run fails, though, the window stays open and waits for Enter,
so the error is still on screen when you come back.

**Install / update** downloads the latest released
`StayWakeBlackScreenIdle.exe`, installs it to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\StayWakeBlackScreen\`, registers it to autostart at
login, and (re)starts it — stopping any already-running copy first so the
file can be replaced. Autostart is a shortcut in your own Startup folder
(`%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`), so you can
see and remove it in Explorer, and nothing here — install, autostart or
uninstall — needs administrator rights. Safe to re-run any time to
update: it always ends up with exactly **one** autostart entry (the
shortcut is replaced, never duplicated, and an autostart registry value
left behind by an older version is removed) and exactly **one** running
instance:

- Setup terminates any already-running copy before replacing the file
  and starting the new one.
- `StayWakeBlackScreenIdle.exe` also refuses to start a second copy of
  itself, via a named mutex — belt and suspenders even if it's ever
  launched some other way while already running.

It only ever downloads the idle variant (`StayWakeBlackScreenIdle.exe`)
— `StayWakeBlackScreen.exe` is left as a manual, run-when-you-want-it
tool.

**Uninstall** removes the Startup shortcut (and the autostart registry
value older versions used), stops any running copy of
`StayWakeBlackScreenIdle.exe` or `StayWakeBlackScreen.exe`, and deletes
the installed files.

For scripted use, `-mode install` or `-mode uninstall` skips the menu
entirely. Other flags: `-install-dir <path>` (override the install
location), `-github-token <token>` (avoid GitHub's unauthenticated API
rate limit, install only), `-no-launch` (install/update without starting
it now, install only), `-no-autostart` (skip the registry entry, install
only), `-keep-files` (remove autostart and stop the process, but leave
the installed files in place, uninstall only).

## Settings reference

`StayWakeBlackScreenIdle.exe` creates
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\StayWakeBlackScreen\config.yaml` on first run:

```yaml
idle_minutes: 3
heartbeat_seconds: 5
start_enabled: true
```

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `idle_minutes` | `3` | Minutes of inactivity (no real keyboard/mouse input) before the screen blacks out. |
| `heartbeat_seconds` | `5` | While blacked out, how often (seconds) the program toggles Caps Lock as a harmless "still alive" signal that keeps Windows from treating the session as idle. |
| `start_enabled` | `true` | Whether the idle guard is active as soon as the program starts. Set to `false` to start paused — no sleep blocking, no blackout — until enabled from the tray menu. |

Edit a value and restart the program to apply it. Each option also has a
matching command-line flag (`-idle-minutes`, `-heartbeat-seconds`,
`-start-enabled`) which, if passed, overrides the config file for that
run only. Config files from older versions may still contain a
`poll_ms` line; it's no longer used (nothing polls any more) and is
ignored.

## How it works

- `SetThreadExecutionState` with `ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED | ES_DISPLAY_REQUIRED`
  tells Windows sleep and display-off must not happen.
- A borderless, topmost, black window is created per monitor instead of
  powering the display off, so Windows never sees a display-off/idle
  transition and has no reason to lock the session.
- Low-level `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` / `WH_MOUSE_LL` hooks swallow all keyboard and
  mouse input system-wide while blacked out — nothing reaches any window,
  including the tool's own. Only Escape is detected (via the hook) to end
  the blackout.
- A periodic synthetic Caps Lock toggle acts as an activity heartbeat some
  environments use to avoid idle/lock detection; the hook lets only this
  specific synthetic keystroke through so the Caps Lock LED actually
  updates, and the final state is cleaned up on exit.
- Nothing polls. The idle guard sets a single timer for the moment the
  idle threshold would be reached (re-arming it for the rest if there was
  input in the meantime), and the input hook wakes the program directly
  when Escape is pressed.
- The tray icon is re-added by the program itself whenever Explorer
  restarts (the `TaskbarCreated` broadcast), which otherwise wipes every
  tray icon for good.
- Setup downloads through WinINet, Windows' own HTTP stack, so it uses
  your system proxy settings and Windows' certificate store.
- **Ctrl+Alt+Del always remains available** — Windows never lets any hook
  suppress it — so it's a hard escape hatch no matter what else goes wrong.
- The tray icon is drawn at runtime (no image assets) as a 32×32
  alpha-blended `HICON` via `CreateDIBSection`/`CreateIconIndirect`.

## Logging

Off by default (nothing is written, no console output, no popups). Pass
`-enable-logging` to write diagnostics to a `.log` file next to the exe,
for troubleshooting only.

## Building from source

Requires Go 1.26+ (matching the `go` directive in `go.mod`).

```
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -trimpath -ldflags "-H=windowsgui -s -w" -o StayWakeBlackScreen.exe ./cmd/staywakeblackscreen
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -trimpath -ldflags "-H=windowsgui -s -w" -o StayWakeBlackScreenIdle.exe ./cmd/staywakeblackscreenidle
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -trimpath -ldflags "-s -w" -o Setup_StayWakeBlackScreenIdle.exe ./cmd/stay-wake-setup
```

Run the tests with `go test ./...`. They cover the OS-independent parts
(config loading, the icon glyph and generator, the Setup menu, and the
timing limits) and run on any platform.

`StayWakeBlackScreenIdle.exe`'s tray tooltip shows a version string,
stamped in via `-X main.version=v1.2.3` appended to its `-ldflags` (the
release build does this from the pushed tag); a build without it just
shows `dev`.

`-H=windowsgui` is what makes the two blackout programs run without a
console window; the setup tool is left as a normal console program so
its progress (and menu) is visible when run from a terminal.

All three `.exe` files also carry the same monitor glyph as their
Explorer/taskbar file icon (the same one `StayWakeBlackScreenIdle.exe`
draws at runtime for its tray icon), embedded via a
`rsrc_windows_amd64.syso` resource file already committed in each `cmd/`
directory - `go build` picks these up automatically, no extra step
needed. If the glyph in `internal/monitoricon` ever changes, regenerate
them with:

```
go run ./tools/genicon monitor.ico
go run github.com/akavel/rsrc@latest -ico monitor.ico -arch amd64 -o cmd/staywakeblackscreen/rsrc_windows_amd64.syso
go run github.com/akavel/rsrc@latest -ico monitor.ico -arch amd64 -o cmd/staywakeblackscreenidle/rsrc_windows_amd64.syso
go run github.com/akavel/rsrc@latest -ico monitor.ico -arch amd64 -o cmd/stay-wake-setup/rsrc_windows_amd64.syso
```

A test fails if those committed icon resources no longer match what the
generator produces, so a changed glyph can't ship half-applied.

## Prebuilt releases and CI

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) tests and
cross-compiles all three `.exe` files and publishes them to a
[GitHub Release](../../releases) whenever a `v*` tag is pushed (or the
workflow is triggered manually). Grab the latest from the
[Releases](../../releases) page, or just run
`Setup_StayWakeBlackScreenIdle.exe` and choose "Install / update" to
fetch and install `StayWakeBlackScreenIdle.exe` automatically.

Every push and pull request to `main` also runs `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
the tests, vet, and a compile of all three `.exe` files, without
publishing anything.

## Requirements

- Windows (Windows Forms-equivalent GUI + Win32 hooks are Windows-only)
